# ZABBIX-DevOps

This project has been developed to show somehow ZABBIX open source monitoring application could be developed in CI/CD environment. ZABBIX architecture has been set up with the docker cluster solution. Docker-compose technology or Kubernetes solution can be used in this regard. For discovery and automation activities git, ansible, and Jenkins would be a constructive approaches. To send the notification related to Zabbix triggers, GMAIL SMTP could be a good choice. Also if you want to design a dashboard with a user-friendly interface, GRAFANA is the base case. You can find here, the code of this project.
